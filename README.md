# Browser_Navigation
Here is an example of how to navigate through any webbrowser automatically. A few things to mention...

    - Chrome Navigation.ipynb is the main code file. If you have jupyter notebook I would recommend downloading it as a .ipynb file
    
    - Stock_Info.csv is an example of the output csv file from the python code.
    
    - You will most likely need to pip install selenium in order to run this code
